The projects consist of programming bank systems to create accounts, store data, and even creating an alarm clock that captures the local time of the computer. All these projects and more are available here: <a

I still use it very much as this site needs functionality, so I enjoy that aspect of it as well. Many say that JavaScript has a steep learning curve however that never stopped me from trying to learn it. Thanks to God and that determination I can happily say that the work I put in is starting to look like it's at an intermediate level in JavaScript. </span>

                    <span id="skill_desc3" class="skill_desc3">PHP is a language I've recently had to teach myself if I wanted my websites to have a back end. I've honestly went weeks trying to figure out why my PHP wasn't installing correctly in my computer but now that it's working fine, I don't regret spending those hours. The fact that I now know how to implement a simple database in a website is a game-changer regarding being a full-stack developer. Now all my websites have a database behind them.

                    <span id="skill_desc4" class="skill_desc4">SQL is a language I've been familiar with for 3+ years. I first heard about it in access during my Computer Application Technology course in Princess Park College. It was interesting how you can manipulate a database through commands, but at that time I had no idea you could take it to another level like you can with a programming language such as PHP.

However, the most prominent out of all of them is successfully being able to create a full-fledged website, or in developer terms, a full stack website, with functional capability both on the front-end and back-end. This website is an example of such a feat.</p>

My knowledge and wisdom continue to grow as I'm undergoing carefully thought-out training by CTU Training Solutions, an IT machine of an institution highly recognised to produce strong-willed learners who know how to get things done, my projects above are evident of that.</p>

                        <p class="career">My career history is filled with my passions such as music and programming. For instance, I produced for multiple videogame companies. Music is a passion of mine where I can be free and express myself exactly how my heart desires, it's an amazing gift that God has given me, and I plan to use it for His glory as well! Alongside that there is programming, although challenging to grasp at first, I found joy solving problems, that wasn't always the case! However, programming helped develop that mentality that life isn't easy, and I must keep pushing to find a solution to my problems.</p>
